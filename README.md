# net-claude-skill — Claude skills for the Net mesh

Two [Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) that teach Claude how to write correct [**Net**](https://github.com/ai-2070/net) integration code:

- **`net-event-bus`** — the mesh: pub/sub, nRPC request/response, agent-to-agent task handoff, the MCP bridge, org capability auth, the gang-claim scheduler, and the RedEX / CortEX / Dataforts layers on top.
- **`net-payments`** — x402 payments on the mesh: price a capability, quote, verify, settle, bill, and spend policy.

Net looks like Kafka/NATS on the surface but has no broker. Net Payments looks like a payment SDK but never moves money. Out of the box, a coding agent will happily write Net code that **compiles, runs, and is wrong** — these skills load the right mental model and verified per-SDK templates instead.

> These are skills *about* Net; they don't install Net itself. The SDK lives at [ai-2070/net](https://github.com/ai-2070/net).

## Install

```bash
npx skills add ai-2070/net-claude-skill --skill '*' -a claude-code -g
```

Installs both skills to `~/.claude/skills/`, available in every project. Drop `-g` to install into the current project's `.claude/skills/` instead — checked in and shared with your team.

<details>
<summary>Other options — one skill, other agents, manual install</summary>

The [`skills` CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) takes a few useful flags:

```bash
npx skills add ai-2070/net-claude-skill                            # interactive picker
npx skills add ai-2070/net-claude-skill --skill net-payments -g    # just one skill
npx skills add ai-2070/net-claude-skill --skill '*' -a '*' -g      # every agent, not just Claude Code
```

These are plain Agent Skills, so `-a '*'` also installs them for Codex, Cursor, Copilot, and friends. The CLI symlinks each agent's skills directory to one canonical copy, so `npx skills update` refreshes them all (pass `--copy` if symlinks aren't an option).

**Without the CLI:** a skill is just a directory containing a `SKILL.md`, so copying the folder in works too.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai-2070/net-claude-skill.git /tmp/net-claude-skill
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -R /tmp/net-claude-skill/net-event-bus /tmp/net-claude-skill/net-payments ~/.claude/skills/
```

Use `<your-repo>/.claude/skills/` instead for a project install. To hack on the skills locally, clone once and symlink the folders so `git pull` updates them in place.

## Check it worked

Restart Claude Code and run `/skills` — **net-event-bus** and **net-payments** should be listed. Then just ask for something Net-shaped:

> *"Wire up a Net publisher and subscriber over the mesh in TypeScript."*
>
> *"Price a Net capability with x402 and charge callers to invoke it."*

Claude loads the matching skill on its own — you never have to name it.

## What's inside

Each skill is a `SKILL.md` entry point plus reference files that Claude loads **only when the task needs them**, so idle cost is one routing table rather than the whole manual.

<summary><b><code>net-event-bus/</code></b> — full file map</summary>

| File | Loaded when |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | Entry point — routing table + the 5-point mental model. |
| `concepts.md` | **Always, before writing code** — why Net is not a broker. |
| `apis.md` | Generating code — verified publish/subscribe/lifecycle templates per SDK. |
| `patterns.md` | Mapping a task ("I need a relay / persistence / fan-out") to a recipe. |
| `mesh.md` | Multi-host deploys — PSK/identity bootstrap, discovery, NAT traversal. |
| `capabilities.md` | Routing to "the GPU node" / a node with model X loaded. |
| `scheduler.md` | Atomically claiming a contended resource (island/slot/seat) + workflows. |
| `streams.md` | Ordered point-to-point delivery with credit-grant backpressure. |
| `nrpc.md` | Request/response — typed call → reply, deadlines, retries, hedging. |
| `a2a.md` | The peer is an **agent**, not a service — task handoff (`serve_a2a` / `submit_task` / `cancel_task`, briefs carry Datafort refs), delegated agent identity (`DelegationChain`), device enrollment (`invite → join → approve`). Rust/Python/Node only. |
| `mcp.md` | The MCP bridge — `net wrap` a stdio server as mesh capabilities, or `net mcp serve` the mesh to a local host; pinning + credential forwarding. |
| `org.md` | Organization capability auth — a service only authorized orgs can discover or call (invisible, not refused): `net-mesh org` offline issuance, `net node adopt`, `serve_org` / `mesh.org(..).call`. |
| `redex.md` | Durable per-channel append-only logs (replay from offset, retention). |
| `cortex.md` | Folded queryable state (SQLite-shaped queries, NetDB). |
| `dataforts.md` | Greedy caching, data gravity, blob refs, read-your-writes. |
| `runtime.md` | Shutdown contract, error handling, async-runtime integration, partitions + healing (a conflicted heal forks, it does not merge). |
| `observability.md` | Catching silent drops; Prometheus/OTel wiring. |
| `payloads.md` | Event schema, size limits, cross-language interop traps. |
| `filter-dsl.md` | Consumer-side content filtering — equality `$and`/`$or`/`$not` predicates on the bus. |
| `error-codes.md` | Classifying a specific error variant — the full core-crate + subsystem taxonomy. |
| `cli.md` | The `net-mesh` CLI — `transfer` (blob/dir) and `typegen` commands, exit codes. |
| `testing.md` | Fixtures, race conditions, CI gotchas. |
| `gotchas.md` | Migrating from Kafka / NATS / Redis Streams / Pulsar. |
| `event-semantics.md` | Naming events / what an event may assert — a fact observed at one layer, not an end-to-end `200 OK`. |
| `examples/` | Minimal runnable hello-world per SDK (TS, Py, Rust, Go, C). |

<summary><b><code>net-payments/</code></b> — full file map</summary>

| File | Loaded when |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | Entry point — routing table + the TL;DR mental model + integration workflow. |
| `concepts.md` | **Always first** — the mental model, the category line, the eight doctrines, the review invariant. |
| `object-model.md` | Touching the five Net envelopes — fields, canonical signing regime, versioning, idempotency, amounts. |
| `x402.md` | Touching x402 structures — `X402Carry` byte-preservation, `PaymentRequirements` / `PaymentPayload`, CAIP ids, the `exact` EVM scheme. |
| `provider.md` | Charging for a capability — the `PaymentEngine` lifecycle (quote → verify → settle → serve → bill), pricing at publish, `serve_payments`. |
| `caller.md` | Paying to invoke — `CallerPaymentFlow` over a `ProviderChannel`, spend check, the approval loop, the MCP gateway path. |
| `facilitator.md` | Wiring the `verify` / `settle` boundary — the `Facilitator` trait, the mock, the real `HttpFacilitator`, config packs, auth. |
| `verification.md` | Confidence — the `observed / confirmed(n) / final` tiers, the independent `ChainChecker`, reorg freeze, replay. |
| `signer.md` | Settlement signing — the `SchemeSigner` seam, `ExternalSigner` / `ExternalSvmSigner` / `ExternalXrplSigner`, EIP-3009 / SPL / XRPL, the no-raw-signing invariant. |
| `spend-policy.md` | Limits, budgets, approvals — `SpendPolicyEngine`, the fail-closed default posture, delegation inheritance. |
| `networks.md` | Enabling a network — CAIP-2 / CAIP-19, the signed asset registry, the Base → Solana → xrpl "config, not code" ladder. |
| `billing.md` | Usage records / a billing stream — `BillingLog` (subscribe/read/export), immutability, what billing is NOT. |
| `http402.md` | A Net agent paying an external x402 HTTP API — the outbound `X402HttpFlow`, the header-only v2 transport. |
| `failure-schematic.md` | Handling denials / refusals — the machine-actionable `net.payment.failure@1` verdict that rides beside the human error, the reason → recovery mapping, `funds_moved` vs `prior_payment`. |
| `bindings.md` | Per-language support — Rust, Python, and Node all have a full demand+supply flow; Go is verifier-only. `CapabilityGateway` / `PaymentProvider`, Node's `close()` + `permissiveChannels` gotchas. |
| `testing.md` | Cross-language golden vectors, the mock conformance suite, the key-invariant negative test, the env-gated live run. |
| `gotchas.md` | Wrong mental model, migrating, or before merging — the review invariant, "what not to build," byte-preservation traps. |
