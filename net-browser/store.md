# The networked store — an authoritative document with replicas

For a **world** rather than a request. One node **hosts** the authoritative
document; other nodes **join** replicas of it. There is no merge, no CRDT and no
lock-step replication: the host is the authority, and a replica holds a
projection it was given.

```js
import { connect, defineStore, hostStore, joinStore } from '@net-mesh/browser';

// Validators: return a clean value or throw (Zod/Valibot `schema.parse` fits).
const num = (v) => (Number.isFinite(Number(v)) ? Number(v) : 0);

// Shared by every page. Validators only — no game rules, no initial state.
const arena = defineStore({
  id: 'my-game.arena',
  version: 1,
  state: (v) => ({ ships: v?.ships ?? {} }),   // REQUIRED: validates a whole state
  empty: () => ({ ships: {} }),                // REQUIRED: absence; must pass `state`
  visibility: 'open',                          // everyone sees every ship — a DECISION, stated
  actions: {                                   // { name: { input, output } } validators
    enlist: { input: () => ({}), output: (v) => ({ id: String(v.id) }) },
    fire: { input: (v) => ({ at: String(v.at) }), output: (v) => ({ hull: num(v.hull) }) },
  },
  inputs: {                                    // { name: validator }
    steer: (v) => ({ dx: num(v.dx), dz: num(v.dz), dt: num(v.dt) }),
  },
});

const node = await connect({ credentialB64, bootstrapUrl });

// On the ONE hosting page:
const host = hostStore({
  definition: arena,
  transport: node,
  initialState: { ships: {} },
  maxEventBytes: 8104,                         // REQUIRED; the joiner passes the same
  // Only `read` requests carry `audience`; `action` / `input` carry `name` + `input`.
  // Branch on `request.type` — a policy that throws is a refusal (`forbidden`).
  authorize: (request) =>
    request.type !== 'action' || request.name !== 'fire' || request.input.at !== request.peer,
  actions: {                                   // HANDLERS, one per declared action
    enlist: (input, context) => {
      const ships = { ...context.getState().ships };
      ships[context.peer] ??= { x: 0, z: 0, hull: 100 };   // keyed by the proven caller
      context.setState({ ships });
      return { id: context.peer };
    },
    fire: (input, context) => {
      const ships = { ...context.getState().ships };
      const target = ships[input.at];
      if (!target) throw new Error('no such ship');       // → action-rejected
      ships[input.at] = { ...target, hull: Math.max(0, target.hull - 25) };
      context.setState({ ships });
      return { hull: ships[input.at].hull };
    },
  },
  inputs: {                                    // HANDLERS, one per declared input
    steer: (input, context) => {
      const ship = context.getState().ships[context.peer];
      if (!ship) return;
      context.setState({ ships: { ...context.getState().ships,
        [context.peer]: { ...ship, x: ship.x + input.dx * input.dt, z: ship.z + input.dz * input.dt } } });
    },
  },
});

// On every OTHER page (never on the host's own node — see § Game recipe):
const replica = joinStore({
  definition: arena, transport: node, host: hostNodeIdHex,
  audience: ['crew'], key: 'player', maxEventBytes: 8104,
});
await replica.ready();
await replica.act('enlist', {});
```

That is the shape of `net/crates/net/browser-ts/README.md` § "Your first
multiplayer scene", which walks the same game through rendering and play. The
package is published as `@net-mesh/browser` (install with `npm install
@net-mesh/browser`, plus `three` for the scene binding); building it from the
repository is in `session.md` § Build it.

**`store` names which store of a definition this is, and a joiner asks for it by
that name.** Both default to the definition id. Name them when one node hosts
several — a second `hostStore` answering to the same name on the same transport
throws `invalid-data` at construction.

## What is authoritative, and where the boundaries are

- **`act` executes on the host** and its result comes back **correlated to the
  request**. This is the shape for anything that must have a verdict: a purchase,
  a spawn, "did my move land".
- **`input` is coalesced and unacknowledged.** The right shape for 60 Hz intent —
  movement, aim, camera. Nothing waits for it, and nothing is guaranteed
  individually; the projection converges.
- **Declare secrets with `visibility` on the definition — prefer it to a
  hand-written `project`.** Path → rule: `'everyone'`, `'nobody'` (host only),
  `'owner'` (the first `*` key is the player's peer id — needs no setup), or a list
  of audiences. `'x.length': 'everyone'` reveals only an array's count. Presets
  `'open'` (say it when everything is public) and `'card-game'`, with overrides
  `{ preset: 'card-game', …}`. Hidden collection entries are REMOVED; hidden
  fields become `HIDDEN` — wrap those fields' validators with `hiddenOr(parse)`
  or `hostStore` throws `invalid-data`. Rules apply after any `project` /
  `projectFor`, so code cannot widen them. With neither `project` nor
  `projectFor`, the rules alone decide. Prove it: `assertHidden(definition,
  state, { peer, audience }, ['players.<peer>.hand'])`. Pass `dev: true` to
  `hostStore` in development. No `team` rule yet — use audiences.
- **`project(state, audience)` decides what each audience may see**, applied by
  the host before anything leaves. A replica cannot read what it was not given;
  do not rely on client-side hiding.
- **Per-player secrets (a hand of cards) need `projectFor(state, { peer,
  audience })`** instead of `project` — `project` is computed once per audience
  and cannot tell two players apart. Give exactly one of the two (both, or
  neither, throws `invalid-data`). `peer` is the same 16-hex id as
  `context.peer`, so a state keyed by `context.peer` is filtered with
  `state.hands[peer]`. It costs one projection per player per change.
- **`authorize(request)` decides whether a request is allowed** — and it is
  consulted on the **ongoing delta feed**, not just at join. A read that policy
  has since revoked stops arriving rather than being served because the handle
  is still warm.
- **Audiences change.** `replica.setAudience(names)` re-negotiates what this
  replica is entitled to see.
- **The store's identity is the peer whose installed session opened the packet.**
  No store frame carries an originator field to consult — so policy is handed the
  authenticated peer, which is the same identity the mesh admitted.

## Options that matter

| Host | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `definition`, `store` | which document type, and which instance of it |
| `transport` | a `StoreTransport` — see below |
| `initialState`, `actions`, `inputs` | the document, and the **handlers** for its transactions and coalesced intents (the definition holds only their validators) |
| `authorize`, `project` / `projectFor` | admission, and visibility per audience (`project`) or per player (`projectFor`) — exactly one |
| `maxEventBytes` | **required** — the bound on one frame; a snapshot over it is chunked (8104 in the package's own tests and demo) |

| Joiner | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `host` | the host's node id (`nodeIdHex`) |
| `store` | which store of the definition to join; defaults to the definition id |
| `audience` | the names this replica claims; `setAudience` re-claims |
| `key` | **required**, a non-empty opaque join token sent on the wire. `authorize` does **not** see it (no `AccessRequest` carries it) — identify callers by `request.peer` |
| `maxEventBytes` | **required**; must agree with the host's frame bound |

**`transport` is structural.** `StoreTransport` is `nodeIdHex()`,
`openStream({ reliability, peer?, label?, lossy? })` (the store itself never
asks for `lossy`; netcode does), `onEvent(handler)`, and an
**optional** `connectPeer(peerHex)`. Use the node from `connect()`. A
`MeshSession` from `openSession()` has the same methods, but a store over
`openSession` is not established (see the end of this file). The `label` form is
not a convenience: the leaf **derives** the stream id from the label and sets a
discriminator bit so an unsolicited arrival classifies as stream data rather
than as a channel message — both ends derive the same id without exchanging one.

**A joiner needs a session with the host, not just a discovery hit.** Sessions
are installed by a peer attempt; that is what `StoreTransport.connectPeer` is
for. When the transport cannot provide it, the store still tries to open and the
typed refusal from `openStream` (`session: no session with 0x…`) is the honest
answer rather than a second guess.

## Lifecycle and timing

| Surface | Calls |
|---|---|
| host handle | `authority` (this node's id), `getState()`, `subscribe(listener)`, `setState(next)`, `setEntities(collection, changes)` / `setEntity(collection, id, value)`, `counts()` (`handles` / `ledgers` / `deferred` / `sparseViews`), `counters()` (refusals only), `close()` |
| replica handle | `getState()`, `subscribe(listener)`, `getStatus()`, `subscribeStatus(listener)`, `ready()`, `act(name, input)`, `input(name, value)`, `setAudience(names)`, `reconnect()`, `close()` |

- **Moving many entities per tick? Use `setEntities`, not `setState`.** Declare
  a per-entity parser on the definition (`entities: { ships: parseShip }`),
  then `host.setEntities('ships', { a: shipA, b: undefined })` (`undefined`
  removes). Only the written entities are validated; the whole-document
  `state` validator does not run. 8,000 ships: ~16 ms → ~2 ms a commit. The
  contract: `state` must impose nothing on that collection beyond each entity
  passing its parser, so keep cross-entity rules in actions. Declare the
  collection in `interest` too, and use declared `visibility` rather than
  `projectFor`: per-player deltas then project only the changed entities
  (`owner` rule, 16 players: 459 → 25 ms).
  `host.counts().sparseViews` shows it running.
- **Host `setState(next)` replaces the whole document.** Inside a handler,
  `context.setState(patch | (state) => patch)` **shallow-merges** the patch into
  the top level. Handlers are **synchronous**: returning a thenable (an `async`
  handler) invalidates the context and the transaction, and a throw becomes
  `action-rejected`. `context.peer` is the authenticated caller's 16-hex node id.
- **`act(name, input)`** returns a promise of the handler's (validated) output,
  or rejects with a `StoreError`. **`input(name, value)`** returns an
  `InputDisposition` synchronously: `{ type: 'queued' }` for the first input of
  that name, `{ type: 'replaced' }` after, `{ type: 'dropped', reason:
  'not-ready' }` when the replica is not ready (before `ready()`, or closed). It
  describes what happened **locally**, never remote acceptance. Neither takes an
  options / `AbortSignal` argument.
- **`getStatus()` is the replica's health** — `phase` and `stale`, plus what the
  sync state machine knows. `subscribeStatus` is how a HUD shows "reconnecting"
  without polling.
- **Measured constants** (exported): replica keepalive `ALIVE_INTERVAL_MS` 20 s,
  host sweep `HOST_SWEEP_MS` 5 s, request deadline `REQUEST_DEADLINE_MS` 10 s,
  outstanding requests `MAX_OUTSTANDING` 64.
- **The host says goodbye.** A closing host sends an unsolicited `owner-lost` to
  every handle it holds — silence is not an answer.
- **`reconnect()` resumes the same handle on a replaced session** (the transport
  session under it was replaced); `ready()` resolves when the view is
  synchronized (and a replica that never synchronizes reports the reason rather
  than hanging forever). After `closed`, **join afresh** with a new `joinStore`;
  after `owner-lost`, do **not** rejoin that host — the world is gone.

## Snapshots, deltas and their bounds

- A snapshot is **chunked**. A replica whose manifest or chunk is lost asks again
  and then reports a typed `timeout` rather than waiting forever.
- A delta applies at the revision it was built on; a gap provokes a **resync**
  (coalesced, so a flood of deltas for a missed generation asks once) instead of
  silently diverging.
- Byte and piece bounds are charged against the manifest's declared total
  *before* holding anything, so concurrent near-empty assemblies cannot exceed
  the table.
- The assembled document is re-parsed under the same depth / duplicate-key /
  finite-number rules a single frame gets.

## `StoreError.code` — what a caller branches on

The wire carries exactly this set:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `invalid-data` | a payload failed its validator |
| `version-mismatch` | definition id/version disagreement between host and joiner |
| `forbidden` | `authorize` refused |
| `not-ready` | the handle has no live, synchronized view yet |
| `capacity` | a declared bound was reached |
| `timeout` | a deadline fired before the answer arrived |
| `aborted` | this handle closed (or was fenced) before the answer, or a newer `setAudience` / transition superseded the request — there is no caller signal to abort with |
| `indeterminate` | submitted, and no response established the outcome |
| `owner-lost` | the store incarnation ended — **terminal**, no handle to obtain |
| `closed` | this handle is unusable: unknown, expired, fenced, or bound elsewhere |
| `action-rejected` | the act ran and was refused on its merits (the handler threw), or a handler broke the synchronous-transaction contract (returned a thenable, nested a transaction) |
| `result-expired` | this request cannot execute again, and its original result is gone |

Two that are easy to get wrong:

- **`owner-lost` is not `closed`.** `closed` is the expiry notice a replica
  *rejoins* on; rejoining an owner that is gone either hangs or attaches you to a
  **successor's different document** under the handle you already had. A
  deliberate farewell says `owner-lost`; silence is what `indeterminate` is for.
- **`result-expired` is not a success.** It asserts nothing about whether the
  original attempt committed — a retired sequence may have been rejected, aborted
  before commit, or fenced without ever executing. Never read it as a receipt.

## `bindEntities` — store state into a scene graph

```typescript
const binding = bindEntities({
  store: replica,
  scene,
  select: (state) => state.ships,
  binding: {
    create: (ship, id) => buildShip(ship, id),
    update: (object, ship) => object.position.set(ship.x, 0, ship.z),
    remove: (object) => object.traverse(disposeOf),
  },
});   // binding.dispose() when you are done
```

- **`@net-mesh/browser/three` imports nothing from `three`.** The scene graph is
  anything with `add` and `remove`, the objects are whatever `create` returns,
  and the types are structural — so the package gains no renderer dependency and
  your scene graph can be a test double.
- **An entity whose reference did not change is not touched.** The store shares
  the references of subtrees that did not change; a loop over
  `Object.values(state.entities)` rebuilding everything throws exactly that away
  and re-creates objects every frame.
- **`select` picks the slice; it is not a narrower subscription.** The binding
  subscribes to the whole store and re-runs `select` on every change. It must
  return a `Record<id, entity>` keyed by stable ids; the identity of its members
  drives `create` / `update` / `remove`.
- Keys are stable identifiers you choose per entity — the same value across a
  state update means "the same object", which is what makes `update` rather than
  `remove`+`create` happen.

## Game recipe — one player hosts, the others join

The path the package's own demo (`net/crates/net/browser-ts/demo/main.js`,
`demo/game.js`) and README take. Each rule below is a failure an agent otherwise
writes.

- **Transport: `connect()`, one tab per player.** A store over `openSession` is
  not established. With `rememberedIdentity()`, all tabs of one origin in one
  browser profile load **one identity** once it is stored, so they are one
  player (two tabs calling it for the first time at once can each create
  their own, so open the second tab after the first has connected): test two
  players with **two browser profiles** (or two browsers), not two tabs.
  Without it, each tab's `connect()` is a new node.
- **`maxEventBytes` is required on both sides and must match** — use 8104.
- **The host player plays through `hostPlayer(host, { audience })`**, never
  `joinStore` on its own node (that throws `invalid-data` — a node has no session
  with itself). `hostPlayer` returns the same handle shape as `joinStore`
  (`ready`, `getState`, `subscribe`, `act`, `input`, `setAudience`, `close`),
  held to the host's own `authorize` with the host's node id as `peer`, and its
  `getState()` is the **projection** for its audience, not the raw document. So
  game code, `bindEntities` included, never branches on "am I the host":

  ```js
  import { hostPlayer } from '@net-mesh/browser';
  const world = isHost
    ? hostPlayer(host, { audience: ['crew'] })
    : joinStore({ definition, transport: node, host: hostId, audience: ['crew'], key: 'player', maxEventBytes: 8104 });
  await world.ready();
  await world.act('enlist', {});
  ```

  Do not hand-roll a wrapper that calls the handlers directly — it skips input
  validation, the transaction, and the result checks a replica gets.

- **Give each player an entity with an `enlist` action keyed by `context.peer`**
  (the authenticated caller — never an id the client sends). A joiner does
  `await replica.ready(); await replica.act('enlist', …)` before steering.
- **Large worlds: interest management.** On the definition, `interest: {
  <top-level entity map>: (entity, id) => key | null }` (any string; `null` =
  delivered to everyone); `cellKey(x, z, size)` is the grid key. A replica joins
  with `interest: cellsAround(x, z, { size, radius? })` and moves with
  `setInterest(keys)` — send `stickyCells(prev, x, z, { size })` only when
  `!sameCells(next, prev)`. Entering/leaving entities arrive as one delta (no
  blank frame); far changes send nothing. Bounds: ≤ 256 keys, ≤ 64 bytes each,
  and the whole set must fit one message. Interest is a filter, NOT a permission
  — keep secrets in `visibility`. `hostPlayer(host, { audience, interest })` and
  `joinLobby({ interest })` take it too. Entity maps must be top-level keys.
- **React to players with the single `onEvent(event, context)` hook** on
  `hostStore` / `createLobby`: `{ type: 'join', peer, audience }`,
  `{ type: 'leave', peer, reason: 'left' | 'expired' | 'refused' | 'dropped' }`,
  `{ type: 'area', peer, from, to }` (from `areaOf(state, peer) → string | null`,
  fired only on change, `from: null` first). It is a transaction like a handler
  (`context.peer` = the player, `setState` reaches every replica, a throw
  discards its writes), runs after the causing frame, and includes the host's own
  player. Put per-player setup (spawn, starter inventory) in `join`, not in an
  `enlist` action the client must remember to call.
- **Inventories:** keep `inventories: Record<peer, Inventory>` in state
  (`Inventory` = item id → count). Change them only with `addItems` /
  `removeItems` (they throw `InventoryError` `full` / `insufficient` /
  `invalid`, which refuses the action with nothing written), read with
  `countItems` / `hasItems` / `inventoryOf`, validate with `parseInventory(value,
  rules)` in the definition's `state`, and hide other players' with
  `projectFor: (state, { peer }) => ({ ...state, inventories: onlyOwn(state.inventories, peer) })`.
  Trading is not built — do not fake it with two independent actions.
- **Prefer a lobby over hand-rolled discovery.** `createLobby({ node, game,
  name, capacity, info?, visibility?, …hostStore options })` hosts the store,
  gives the host `lobby.self` (a `hostPlayer`), and re-announces on its own;
  `listLobbies({ node, game })` returns `{ code, name, players, capacity, info,
  host, store }`; `joinLobby({ node, definition, game, code | lobby })` finds
  the host and returns a `joinStore` handle (await `ready()`). Capacity counts
  the host; a full lobby answers `forbidden`. `lobby.kick(peer)` is immediate.
  `joinLobby` throws `LobbyError` `not-found` / `ambiguous` (two nodes claim
  the code — never pick one) / `invalid`. A lobby owns its node's
  announcements: pass the node's other tags as `tags` to `createLobby` **and**
  to `joinLobby` (a joiner announces a `seek` tag so the host can find it, and
  an announcement replaces the whole tag set). Unlisted lobbies are not secret —
  gate with `authorize`. Codes: `lobby.link()` / `lobbyCodeFromUrl()`.
- **Lobby gotchas a real game hit** (Rose & Blade):
  - **An empty `listLobbies` right after `connect()` is not real yet.**
    Announcements take a moment to reach a node that just connected. Poll
    every 500 ms for about 4 s before showing "no games".
  - **A closed tab's lobby stays listed until its announcement lapses.** The
    host re-announces every `LOBBY_ANNOUNCE_MS` (2 s); a tab killed outright
    withdraws nothing. Expect a stale entry for a short while, and a
    `joinLobby` that answers `not-found`.
  - **Close a joined lobby before creating one on the same node.** Closing
    the joiner announces the node's own `tags` again, and an announcement
    replaces the whole tag set, so it wipes a listing created a moment before.
    This matters when the host leaves and another player takes over: `await
    joined.close()` first, then `createLobby`. `close()` resolves only once
    the withdrawal (after any announcement still in flight) has settled,
    so awaiting it orders the two. A failed withdrawal is swallowed, not
    thrown.
  - **Taking over a lobby.** The joiner sees the host go as `subscribeStatus`
    reporting `phase` `closed` or `failed`. Its `error` is `null` when the
    host said goodbye: `owner-lost` surfaces only from the next `ready()` /
    `act()` on the handle, so don't wait for it in the listener. The new host re-opens it with `createLobby` and the same `info`
    (Rose & Blade carries its fight id there), so the others find the same
    game under a new code.
  - **The credential's `game` and the lobby's `game` are separate names.**
    `requestCredential({ game })` picks the anchor game (the isolation
    boundary); `createLobby({ game })` / `listLobbies({ game })` scope the
    listings inside it. They may differ.
- **Discovery before join** (without a lobby). Share the host's `node.nodeIdHex()` out of band (the
  demo uses a `?host=<hex>` link). The host announces a tag and **re-announces
  every ~2 s** — announcements are leases that expire. The joiner polls
  `node.query(tag)` until the host is present — compare with
  `peerIdHex(descriptor.nodeId)`, since a descriptor's `nodeId` is decimal — and
  only then calls `joinStore`; joining a host it has never seen fails with
  `session: no session with 0x…`.

  ```js
  // host page
  await node.announce(['my-game.host']);
  setInterval(() => node.announce(['my-game.host']).catch(() => {}), 2_000);
  // joiner page
  for (let i = 0; ; i++) {
    const hosts = await node.query('my-game.host');
    if (hosts.some((d) => peerIdHex(d.nodeId) === hostId)) break;
    if (i >= 80) throw new Error('the host never showed up');
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 250));
  }
  ```

- **`project` returns a full, valid `S`**, never a partial. Hidden = absent from
  a collection, or an explicit `null` field; `empty()` means absence. A zero must
  never stand for "you cannot see this".
- **`bindEntities` details.** `update` is **not** called right after `create`, so
  `create` must set the initial transform itself. `remove` (optional) runs after
  the object has already left the scene — dispose per-entity resources there.
  A throwing `create` / `update` / `remove` goes to `onError` (default
  `console.error`) and the rest of the frame continues. The binding also exposes
  `apply()` (reconcile now), `object(id)`, `size` and `dispose()`.
- **Store naming.** The name defaults to the definition id; a lobby and a match
  on one host need `store: 'lobby'` / `store: 'match'` on both sides, and two
  stores with the same name on one transport throw `invalid-data`.
- **Prototype offline first** with `@net-mesh/browser/local`:
  `const mesh = createLocalMesh(); const hostNode = mesh.node(); const guestNode = mesh.node();`
  — each node is a `transport` for `hostStore` / `joinStore`, in one page, with
  the real store and no anchor or network. Local nodes also `announce(tags)` and
  `query(tag)` like a real node (another node's announcement, never your own;
  it expires after 300 s unless re-announced), so the find-the-host loop works
  offline unchanged. It proves game logic, not that two
  browsers can connect; switch the nodes to `connect()` for that. The package
  demo (`net/crates/net/browser-ts/demo/`) runs this way by default.

## What is not established (do not present it as proven)

- **Two tabs sharing a leader, around a store.** This package's tests exercise a
  host and a joiner in **one tab**. The store's own use of a proxied handle on a
  follower — last-consumer cleanup, the peer/stream lifecycle across a leader
  change — is recorded as not established in
  `net/crates/net/browser-ts/src/store/index.ts`. The leader-proxy surface a
  follower uses is newer than the store, and it is not witnessed for this case.
- **A store over `openSession`.** Same gap, from the page's side: a `MeshSession`
  satisfies `StoreTransport` structurally, but only `connect()` is the supported
  store transport.
- **The fake-wasm unit tests prove drift, not behaviour.** They satisfy the
  declared wasm boundary at compile time; the real artifact is exercised by the
  Playwright matrix in `net/crates/net/tests/rtc_browser/` and by the worked demo
  at `net/crates/net/examples/browser-demo/`.
