"""Scoped credentials, not an open channel.

Two nodes. The publisher owns a channel whose subscriber ACL is rooted at
its own entity id; a subscriber holding a token minted for *its* entity id,
for *this* channel, with the subscribe scope is admitted. The same
subscriber asking without the token is refused.

This is the shape a broker makes you build out of ACL files and a separate
auth service: there is one identity, one token, one place the decision is
made, and the credential is presented per subscribe rather than cached by a
connection.

Run:

    python tokenchannel.py

Expected final line: ``RESULT ok granted=1 refused=1``
