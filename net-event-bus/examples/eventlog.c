/*
 * The event log you no longer run (C).
 *
 * One node, one local append-only log. Eight records are appended, replayed
 * from the start, then replayed again from a consumer checkpoint — and the
 * second replay is three records, not eight, because the offset is the
 * consumer's own bookkeeping and the log is not asked to remember it.
 *
 * Kafka needs a cluster for this. `RedexFile` is one file with a monotonic
 * sequence, and the consumer's position lives in the consumer.
 *
 * Mirrors examples/eventlog.rs.
 *
 * Build: gcc eventlog.c -lnet -lpthread -ldl -lm && ./a.out
 *
 * Expected final line: RESULT ok records=8 replayed=8 resumed=3
