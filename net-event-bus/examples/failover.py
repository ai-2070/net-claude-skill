"""The sidecar you no longer run: call a service, not a host.

Two providers serve the same service name. A caller addresses the **service**
— never a node id — and when the provider that answered first goes away, the
next call lands on the survivor, with a bounded retry loop absorbing the
transient while the dead provider is still in the roster.

This is the service-mesh shape collapsed into the bus: no sidecar to
configure, no separate load balancer, no certificate rotation, and no
endpoint list to keep in sync. The roster *is* the capability fold.

Run:

    python failover.py

Expected final line: ``RESULT ok providers=2 moved=1 served=2``
