"""Paid agent-to-agent admission, end to end in one process (Python).

Run: python a2a_paid.py

What it proves: a provider that is **explicitly paid** by configuration
refuses free work, quotes before any money moves, and runs the task exactly
once after the caller pays for that exact reservation. Both halves are real —
a `PaymentProvider` with a `PaymentEngine`, a durable admission journal on
disk, and a `CapabilityGateway` with a spend policy and a durable purchase
store. Nothing is stubbed.

The two nodes are in one process only so the example is a single file. Nothing
about the flow depends on that: they are separate mesh nodes that complete a
real noise handshake over loopback UDP and speak the same wire two machines
would.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: settle on a real chain. The facilitator is
the mock (`unsafe_dev_mock_facilitator=True`), which is the only honest choice
for an example — a runnable rail needs funded keys and a testnet. The
*lifecycle* is real; the settlement is not. See `payments.md`.

The order is the whole design, and it is what the three numbered steps below
show: everything that can refuse the work happens BEFORE a quote exists, and
the launch is claimed durably BEFORE the executor is spawned.
