# Go binding

Read `../apis.md` first for the four surfaces and the cross-SDK rules. This page
is only what is Go-specific.

## Module and import

```go
import "github.com/ai-2070/net/go"
```

**There is one Go tree: `go/`**, the module `github.com/ai-2070/net/go`, which
is what `go get` gives you. An older, uncompiled Go reference tree (no `go.mod`) used to sit beside the Rust FFI crates; it was removed. What it had either ships in `go/` now or is not available from Go, and its source stays in git history at commit `610cd4e`. Surfaces that were only in the reference
tree and are not yet in the module — the resilience helpers (`RetryPolicy`,
`CallWithRetry`, `HedgePolicy`, `CallWithHedge`, `CircuitBreaker`), the capability
predicate and placement builders, Deck ICE / audit / log streams, and the richer
MeshDB operators — are not available from Go.

Go is cgo: it links against the Rust cdylibs. A build needs those built first,
which is why CI type-checks the example with `go vet` rather than `go build`.

## Construction and lifecycle

```go
bus, err := net.New(&net.Config{NumShards: 4})
if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) }
defer bus.Shutdown()

bus.IngestRaw(`{"sensor_id":"A1","celsius":22.5}`)

resp, _ := bus.Poll(100, "")
for _, raw := range resp.Events {
    // resp.Events is []json.RawMessage (= [][]byte). Convert to string before
    // printing, or fmt.Println renders the raw bytes.
    fmt.Println(string(raw))
}
if resp.HasMore {
    resp, _ = bus.Poll(100, resp.NextID)   // pass the cursor to page forward
}
```

Mesh transport is a **separate constructor**: `net.NewMeshNode(cfg)` with its own
`MeshConfig` and its own `Shutdown`. `net.New` gives you the bus only.

## The runtime model — you write the loop

**On the bus there is no async iterator and no tagged-topic API.** Write the
polling loop yourself and carry `NextID` across calls. Filter by inspecting the
JSON in the loop.

This is about `net.New` (the bus). **Distributed mesh channels are a separate,
fully present surface** on `net.NewMeshNode`: `RegisterChannel`,
`SubscribeChannel` / `SubscribeChannelWithToken`, `Publish`, `RecvShard`. What
Go lacks is the TS/Python `node.channel()` convenience label over local
ingestion — not distributed pub/sub. See `bindings/coverage.md` for what the
mesh surface does and does not carry here.

All methods are thread-safe.

## Names and shapes

- `bus.IngestRaw(json string) error`
- `bus.Poll(limit int, cursor string) (*PollResponse, error)` →
  `PollResponse { Events, NextID, HasMore }`
- `PollResponse.Events` is `[]json.RawMessage` (= `[][]byte`). Pass each through
  `string(...)` to print, or `json.Unmarshal` to parse.
- Discovery is `FindBestNode` — Go and Rust are the two bindings that select one
  node for you. `AnnounceCapabilities` announces.
- nRPC goes through a handle: `NewTypedMeshRpc`, then `Call` / `Serve` and the
  streaming variants. ABI drift is detected via `net.ABIVersion()` against
  `net.ExpectedABIVersion`.

## The buffer-capacity rule no compiler enforces

`ring_buffer_capacity` must be a **power of two and at least 1024**. It is
validated in the shared core config at construction, so every binding raises the
same way — and no compile or type check catches it. The default is 1,048,576
(1M events per shard), which is also why a "demonstrate backpressure" snippet
that emits a few thousand events into a default node drops nothing at all.

Spelt `net.Config{RingBufferCapacity: 1024}` in this binding.

## Errors

Methods return `error`. There is no exception path and no throwing convention to
port from TypeScript.

## Shutdown

`defer bus.Shutdown()`. A `MeshNode` has its own `Shutdown` — if you built both,
shut down both.

## Protected services (org)

Org capability auth is fully in the **shipped** module (`go/org.go`) — no
reference-tree caveat, unlike the resilience helpers above. It carries its own
ABI handshake, independent of the rest of the binding: `orgABIVersion = 0x0002`,
checked in `init()`, which hard-fails on a mismatch.

The unary typed call is a **free function** — `net.OrgCall[Req, Resp](ctx,
client, service, req)` (Go forbids type parameters on methods) — while the
streaming verbs are **methods** on `*OrgClient`: `CallStreaming`,
`CallClientStream`, `CallDuplex`, returning the shared nRPC handles
(`*RpcStream`, `*ClientStreamCall`, `*DuplexCall`). Provider side: `net.ServeOrg`,
`net.ServeOrgStreaming`, `net.ServeOrgClientStream`, `net.ServeOrgDuplex`. On the
three streaming methods an unset deadline (`0`, or a `ctx` carrying none) means the
facade's **300 s** protected-call lifetime, never "no deadline"; unary `OrgCall`
/ `CallBytes` stays unbounded at `0`. Full contract: `org.md`.

## Gaps — Go is the least complete binding

Check `bindings/coverage.md` before promising anything. The three to know:

- **No A2A.** Free or paid, serving or calling: not partial, not core-only
  — there is no A2A symbol in the Go
  tree at all.
- **No consumer-side filter DSL.** No predicate surface, no `where` RPC header.
  `CapabilityFilter` in `go/mesh.go` is channel *authorisation*, and
  `go/meshdb.go`'s "filter predicates" are MeshDB query predicates — neither is
  the bus filter DSL. Filter in your handler.
- **Blobs are complete.** `MeshBlobAdapter` does `Store` / `Fetch` / `Exists`,
  trees, range reads, repair and the overflow controls; `MeshNode.FetchBlob`
  and `FetchBlobDiscovered` (no known holder) retrieve over the mesh; and
  `RegisterBlobAdapter` puts a Go-implemented adapter in the process-wide
  registry.
- **Payments: none.** The only payments file in the module is a golden-vector
  test. See `../../net-payments/bindings/coverage.md`.

## Where to look when this page is not enough

- **Authoritative source:** `go/` — `net.go` for the bus, `mesh.go` for mesh,
  `mesh_rpc_typed.go` for nRPC.
- **Checked examples:** `../examples/hello.go` and `../examples/observe.go` — the
  second pins the Go-cased stats fields, including the misspelled
  `BatchesDispathed`. Type-checked with `go vet` in CI. Not linked, not run.

## Never infer from another binding

- There are **no named channels and no async iteration**. A TypeScript
  `for await (const x of ch.subscribe())` has no Go equivalent; you poll.
- Errors are returned, never thrown.
- Go has **no nRPC resilience helpers** (`RetryPolicy`, `HedgePolicy`,
  `CircuitBreaker`). They lived only in the reference tree, which has been
  removed; do not tell a user to look for them there.
- `go/` is the whole Go surface. A symbol absent from it is absent from Go.
