# Node / TypeScript binding

Read `../apis.md` first for the four surfaces and the cross-SDK rules. This page
is only what is TypeScript-specific.

## Packages and import

```bash
npm install @net-mesh/sdk @net-mesh/core
```

```typescript
import { NetNode } from '@net-mesh/sdk';
```

**Two packages, and the split matters.** `@net-mesh/sdk` is the ergonomic
wrapper; `@net-mesh/core` is the napi binding underneath it. Several surfaces
are reachable *only* from `@net-mesh/core` — payments is entirely there, and
`bindings/coverage.md` marks each one `core-only`. If an import from
`@net-mesh/sdk` does not resolve, check the matrix before concluding the feature
is missing.

## Construction and lifecycle

```typescript
interface TempReading { sensor_id: string; celsius: number }

// A transport that STORES. The default (memory) selects the Noop
// adapter, which counts batches and discards them — publish succeeds
// and `subscribe()` then yields nothing, forever. Use memory for
// ingestion, batching, backpressure, counters and lifecycle; use
// redis / jetstream / mesh the moment a consumer has to receive
// something. Per-transport fields are on `Transport` in src/types.ts.
const node = await NetNode.create({
  shards: 4,
  transport: { type: 'redis', url: 'redis://127.0.0.1:6379' },
});

const temps = node.channel<TempReading>('sensors/temperature');
temps.publish({ sensor_id: 'A1', celsius: 22.5 });

for await (const r of temps.subscribe()) {
  console.log(`${r.sensor_id}: ${r.celsius}°C`);
}

await node.shutdown();
```

That is a **tagged EventBus topic** — one node, many logical streams over its
own bus. It is not distributed pub/sub: for two nodes to exchange events by
channel name, use `MeshNode.registerChannel` / `subscribeChannel` /
`publishChannel`. See `concepts.md` § Channel.

**`NetNode.create(config)` is async — you must `await` it.** This is the first
thing that differs from Python, where construction is synchronous.

## Names and shapes

- `node.channel<T>('name', validator?)` — the named-channel surface. The
  optional validator runs on each received event.
- `subscribe()` returns an **async iterable**. Always consume with
  `for await...of`.
- `emitBuffer(Buffer)` is the zero-copy path — use it when the payload is
  already serialized.
- `ingestFire(...)` / `ingestBatchFire(...)` / `ingestRawSync(...)` are the
  lower-level ingestion entry points the channel surface sits on.

## The buffer-capacity rule no compiler enforces

`ring_buffer_capacity` must be a **power of two and at least 1024**. It is
validated in the shared core config at construction, so every binding raises the
same way — and no compile or type check catches it. The default is 1,048,576
(1M events per shard), which is also why a "demonstrate backpressure" snippet
that emits a few thousand events into a default node drops nothing at all.

Spelt `bufferCapacity: 1024` in this binding.

## Errors — the failure shape varies by method

Ingestion is synchronous, but there are three distinct failure conventions and
mixing them up is the standard TypeScript bug here.

| Method | Returns | On failure |
|---|---|---|
| `emit(obj)`, `emitRaw(json)` | `Receipt` | **throws** |
| `emitBatch(objs)`, `emitRawBatch(jsons)` | `number` ingested | throws on shutdown; short count on `drop_*` |
| `channel.publish`, `channel.publishBatch`, `emitBuffer`, `fire`, `fireBatch` | `boolean` / `number` | returns `false` or a short count — see the `JSON.stringify` caveat below |

- `emit` used to be typed `Receipt | null` even though no branch could return
  `null`; the underlying napi binding throws on ingestion failure. The type is
  now `Receipt`. Wrap in `try/catch`; do not null-check.
- "Never throws" holds only for *ingestion*. `channel.publish` and
  `channel.publishBatch` call `JSON.stringify` first, which throws on cyclic
  structures and `bigint` values and runs any getter on your event. That throw
  happens before the bus is reached, so nothing was published.
- For the batch forms, compare the returned count against the input length to
  detect partial drops.
- Under the default `drop_oldest` / `drop_newest` modes the throwing methods
  **do not throw on backpressure either** — drops are silent and visible only
  through `node.stats().eventsDropped`.
- `BackpressureError` and `NotConnectedError`, and the `sendWithRetry` helper,
  are **mesh-stream APIs** on `MeshNode` — peer-to-peer streams, not the bus.
  The bus emit path never raises them. See `runtime.md`.

## Shutdown

`await node.shutdown()`, and it is idempotent.

**There is nothing to close first.** A `TypedChannel` from `node.channel(...)`
has no `close()` and no lifecycle of its own — it is a name, a prebuilt filter
string, and an optional validator, all owned by the node. Construct as many as
you like and drop them by letting them go out of scope. What *does* need
stopping is a live subscription: call `stream.stop()` on any `subscribe()` /
`subscribeRaw()` iterator you are not draining, or the polling loop keeps
running against a shut-down bus.

## Gaps

`bindings/coverage.md` is authoritative. The one to know up front: A2A is
`core-only` here — `serveA2a` is on `@net-mesh/core`, not the wrapper.

## Where to look when this page is not enough

- **Authoritative source:** `net/crates/net/sdk-ts/src/` — `node.ts`,
  `channel.ts`, `stream.ts`, `types.ts` — over
  `net/crates/net/bindings/node/`, where the napi surface is declared in Rust.
- **Checked examples:** `../examples/hello.ts` and `../examples/observe.ts` — the
  second pins the `bigint` counters and the boolean-returning `publish` path.
  Type-checked against the SDK source in CI; nothing proves they run.

## Never infer from another binding

- Construction is **async** here and **synchronous** in Python. `with
  NetNode(...)` has no TypeScript analogue and `await NetNode.create(...)` has no
  Python one.
- Rust has no `channel()` at all — do not port a channel example to Rust.
- Discovery is `findNodes` / `findNodesScoped` / `findServiceNodes`, returning a
  **list**, plus `findBestNode` / `findBestNodeScoped`, which apply the
  requirement's weights and return one `bigint | null`. `null` is no match;
  `0n` is a real node id, so test `=== null`, never falsiness.
- The three-way return convention above is TypeScript's alone. Python raises,
  Go and C return error codes.
