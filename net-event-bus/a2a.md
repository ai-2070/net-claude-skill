# Agent-to-Agent Handoff, Delegated Identity, Device Enrollment

Three surfaces that come up when the thing you're integrating is an **agent**
rather than a service. All three ship in Rust, Python and Node/TypeScript.
**Go has none of them** — if the user is on Go, say so rather than generating
a call that doesn't exist.

---

## When A2A is the wrong answer

Reach for A2A only when you want **parallelism**: a long job runs on another
agent while this one keeps working, and can be cancelled mid-run.

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Short call, need the answer before continuing | `nrpc.md` — a capability |
| Sequential work in one agent's own context | Direct capabilities, not A2A |
| Long job runs elsewhere, you continue | **A2A** |

The reason it's a separate surface: **the executor does not share your
memory.** Handing work to another agent is briefing a colleague who wasn't in
the room. The protocol makes that explicit instead of pretending otherwise —
which is why the brief carries *references*, not inlined context.

## The brief carries refs, not content

`TaskBrief` = the job + the context the executor needs, as **Datafort artifact
refs**. Put the context in Dataforts (`dataforts.md`), hand over the refs. If
you find yourself inlining a large context blob into a brief, you're modelling
a shared memory that doesn't exist.

`TaskState`:

```text
requested → accepted → running → completed{ref} | failed | cancelled
```

`completed` carries a ref for the same reason the brief does.

## Executor side

```rust
// Rust — node must be start()ed first.
let handles = mesh.serve_a2a(registry, executor)?;   // Vec<ServeHandle>
// Hold the handles. Dropping them unregisters the services.
```

```python
handle = mesh.serve_a2a(callback)          # A2aServeHandle
```

```typescript
const handle = await mesh.serveA2a(executor, options);   // A2aServeHandle
```

`serve_a2a` registers **three** services at once — submit, status, cancel.
Rollback is automatic: if the third fails to register, the first two
unregister as the error returns. You never end up half-serving.

**A malformed brief is not an out-of-band failure.** It answers a
`TaskAck { accepted: false }` that the requester reads. Don't wrap `serve_a2a`
in a handler that expects exceptions for bad input — the rejection is a value
on the normal path.

## Requester side

```rust
let ack: TaskAck              = mesh.submit_task(target, brief).await?;
let rec: Option<TaskRecord>   = mesh.task_status(target, &task_id).await?;
let stopped: bool             = mesh.cancel_task(target, &task_id).await?;
```

```python
task_id = mesh.submit_task(target_node_id, prompt, context_refs, tags)
status  = mesh.task_status(target_node_id, task_id)    # Optional[str]
stopped = mesh.cancel_task(target_node_id, task_id)    # bool
```

```typescript
const taskId  = await mesh.submitTask(targetNodeId, prompt, contextRefs, tags);
const status  = await mesh.taskStatus(targetNodeId, taskId);   // string | null
const stopped = await mesh.cancelTask(targetNodeId, taskId);   // boolean
```

Two traps:

- **`task_status` returning `None` / `null` means "no record of that id,"**
  not "the task failed." Don't collapse them.
- **Cancel is cooperative.** The executor observes a `CancelToken` and stops
  cleanly; it is not killed. `cancel_task` returns whether the cancel took
  effect. An executor that never checks its token will not stop, so if you are
  writing the executor, check the token in your loop.

---

## Paid A2A: prepare → purchase → submit

**Free or paid is the provider's configuration, never the caller's
choice.** `serve_a2a` is the free path and is unchanged. The catalog-driven
path (`serve_a2a_configured` in Rust, `PaymentProvider.serve_a2a_configured`
in Python) requires every service to be *explicitly* free or paid, and
**refuses to start** rather than degrade: a paid service with no pricing
terms, a free service carrying pricing terms, or a paid service with no
payment gate or no admission journal are all serve-time errors.

Free still means *no payment*, not *no policy* — a free configured service
runs the preflight and enforces capacity.

The order is the design. Everything that can refuse the work happens
**before a quote exists**; the launch is claimed durably **before** the
executor is spawned.

| Verb | Does | Money |
|---|---|---|
| `prepare_task` | validate, preflight, reserve capacity, mint the admission id, quote | none — read-only on the money side |
| `purchase_task` | spend policy, author the payload once, pay | the one charge |
| `submit_task` | send the brief + the stored proof; provider redeems, claims, runs | none |

```python
import json, time
from net import CapabilityGateway

# All three paths are required for a paid purchase: the spend policy and
# profile authorize it, the purchase store makes the attempt resumable.
# A gateway built without the policy raises ValueError on prepare_task.
gw = CapabilityGateway(
    mesh,
    payment_policy_path="state/payment-policy.json",
    payment_profile="dev_test",
    a2a_purchase_path="state/a2a-purchases.json",
)

# 1. Prepare — no money moves. Show the price, then decide.
#    `busy` reserved nothing and quoted nothing, so it is retryable — it is
#    also how a not-yet-routable first call to a fresh peer reports itself.
for _ in range(8):
    prep = json.loads(gw.prepare_task(
        provider_node_id, "research", "summarize the quarterly filings",
        context_refs=["artifact:q3-filings"],
    ))
    if prep["status"] != "busy":
        break
    time.sleep(0.1)
if prep["status"] != "ok":                   # rejected | retired | conflict
    raise SystemExit(f"provider refused to prepare: {prep['status']}")
prepared = json.dumps(prep["prepared"])      # the complete handle; pass it on
print("quote", prep["quote"]["quote_id"], prep["quote"]["amount"])

# 2. Purchase — consumes THAT quote. Never re-quote a live attempt.
buy = json.loads(gw.purchase_task(prepared))
if buy["status"] == "requires_payment_approval":
    gw.approve_payment(buy["quote_id"])      # operator decision
    buy = json.loads(gw.purchase_task(prepared))
for _ in range(8):
    # Two retryable shapes, not one. `unknown` is a lost pay reply, not a
    # refusal — the SAME stored payment resolves it, so this call re-sends
    # it and does not buy a second time. `failed` with `retryable: true` is
    # a transient local condition (a store read, a sibling still authoring
    # this purchase, a prepare still in flight); it also re-sends, and
    # treating it as terminal is what pushes a caller into re-preparing.
    if buy["status"] == "unknown" or (
        buy["status"] == "failed" and buy.get("retryable")
    ):
        time.sleep(0.2)
        buy = json.loads(gw.purchase_task(prepared))
        continue
    break
if buy["status"] != "paid":                  # denied | failed | unknown
    # denied + funds_ambiguous=True is NOT proven non-payment: an operator
    # resolves it with gw.a2a_resolve_attempt(...). Do not retry it. An
    # `unknown` still standing here is the same kind of money: resolve the
    # attempt, never prepare a second one.
    raise SystemExit(f"not paid: {buy['status']} {buy.get('policy_reason')}")

# 3. Submit — the stored proof, byte-identical on every retry.
for _ in range(8):                           # e.g. journal_unavailable, Busy
    ack = json.loads(gw.submit_task(prepared))
    if ack["status"] != "retry":
        break
    time.sleep(0.2)
if ack["status"] != "accepted":              # retry | unexecutable
    # Nothing was admitted, so there is no task to poll: `task_status` would
    # answer `None` forever. `unexecutable` keeps its evidence — the exit is
    # gw.a2a_resolve_attempt(...), never a fresh prepare.
    raise SystemExit(f"not accepted: {ack['status']} {ack.get('message')}")
print("accepted", ack["task_id"])
```

Only now is there a task to watch: poll
`mesh.task_status(provider_node_id, ack["task_id"])` until it is terminal.

The snippet above is the caller half against an already-running provider. For
a complete, **runnable** version that stands up both sides — provider with a
real engine, gate and journal; caller with a spend policy and purchase store —
see `examples/a2a_paid.py` (and `examples/a2a_paid.rs` for the Rust surface).
CI executes both on every pull request and matches their output, so they
cannot rot into something that merely compiles.

**Four traps.**

- **Never re-quote an unresolved attempt.** `purchase_task` re-sends the
  *stored* payload, which the engine answers idempotently. A fresh quote for
  the same work is a second charge. `prepare_task` on a live attempt refuses.
- **`unknown` is not `denied`.** A lost pay reply leaves the attempt
  `unknown`; calling `purchase_task` again resolves it through the stored
  payment. Treating it as a failure and re-preparing is the bug this store
  exists to prevent.
- **`unexecutable` keeps its evidence.** A paid submit the provider will not
  execute (`no_reservation`, `admission_revoked`) is not a lost payment —
  the proof and billing stay on the attempt, and `a2a_resolve_attempt` is the
  only exit. Same for `denied {funds_ambiguous: true}`.
- **Operator queues do not drain themselves.** `gw.a2a_attempts()` (caller)
  and `PaymentProvider.a2a_unresolved()` (provider) accumulate by design:
  money moved, or may have. Nothing prunes them.

**Refusals.** Payment/admission refusals arrive as the `ERR_PAYMENT`
application error with a `net-failure-schematic` header — reasons
`missing_quote`, `binding_required`, `binding_rejected`, `no_reservation`,
`input_binding_mismatch`, `admission_revoked`, and `journal_unavailable`
(the one retryable row). Non-financial rejections stay in-body as
`TaskAck { accepted: false }`: unknown service, stale revision, bounds
exceeded, `Busy`, `Retired`.

**After a provider restart**, status can answer a new terminal state,
`interrupted{detail}` — `paid_not_started` (resumes on the recorded payment,
launches once), `outcome_unknown` (never relaunched), `admission_revoked`
(operator resolves). Python and Node pass it through as JSON; a **Rust
requester built before it existed cannot decode it**. It is the one wire
addition of the paid path, and only a configured catalog emits it.

**Paid serving is Rust and Python only.** Node/TypeScript is requester-side
(free) and Go has no A2A at all — say so rather than generating a call that
does not exist.

## Delegated agent identity

**Two different things are called "delegation."** Permission tokens
(`mesh.md`, `error-codes.md`) delegate *authority to do something*.
`DelegationChain` derives *who someone is* — a child identity acting for a
parent principal. A token says "you may"; a chain says "you are acting for."
Don't reach for one when the user means the other.

```rust
let child_seed = derive_child_seed(&parent_seed, "gateway-eu");
```

Deterministic: same parent + same label always yields the same child, so an
agent identity survives a restart with no second private key stored anywhere.
The parent seed never leaves its holder.

`DelegationChain` builds the signed path — `derive_gateway`, `derive_device`,
`extend_delegate`, `extend_to_subagent` — and reads back with `verify()`,
`subjects()`, `leaf()`, `root()`, `expires_at()`, `len()`.

**Chains expire.** An agent identity is not permanent by default. And a chain
that verifies structurally can still be revoked — `RevocationRegistry` is what
a verifier consults. Structural verification alone is not authorization.

## Device enrollment

`invite → join → approve`, with no private key ever pasted or transmitted.

- `InviteToken::mint(root, rendezvous, ttl)` — operator mints a short-lived
  invite. Encodes to a string for out-of-band transport; carries
  `root_fingerprint()` so the joiner can confirm which root it's joining.
- `JoinRequest::create(..)` — the device generates **its own** keypair and
  self-signs. `verify_self_signature()` proves it wasn't tampered with.
- Approve — the root issues the chain.

`fingerprint(entity)` is the short human-comparable form. The out-of-band
fingerprint check by a human is the step that matters; if the user's design
skips it, the invite is only as good as the channel it travelled over.

Invites expire (`is_expired(now)`); failures are `EnrollmentError`.

### Managed-node links (V3)

At the CLI level the same ceremony is a `netmesh-join_` link → `join` → `up`.
**One signed token carries several relations, each authorized on its own** —
mesh membership, a subnet attachment (`--subnet`), org membership (`--org`,
always operator-approved) and a channel credential (`--channel` /
`--channel-rights`). The roots that authorize them stay offline (`subnet
issue-issuer`, `channel issue-grant`, `org approve`); the node carries only
what the link names.

- **A token is a bearer secret unless bound.** `--for <ENTITY>` binds a link to
  one device's entity id; until then, whoever holds it can redeem it — treat it
  like a password.
- **`--require-approval` holds issuance** until `invite approve`; it is the
  link-level counterpart of the human fingerprint check above.
- **Attach tries direct first, then the relay.** `join` reports `enroll_path`
  and `attach_path` — `direct`, `relay`, or `relay_tcp` when UDP to the relay
  went unanswered (`relay serve` / `up --relay` supply the fallback). A
  registered relay is not a prerequisite: a reachable direct path wins.
- **`wrap --joined <state-dir>` / `mcp serve --joined <state-dir>`** run a
  provider or consumer as the enrolled device without re-supplying secrets —
  the identity, mesh PSK and enrolled contact all come from that join store. It
  refuses while `up` owns the store, and refuses `--psk-hex`. An explicit
  `--node-addr` / `--node-pubkey` / `--node-id` names another peer of the same
  mesh (e.g. a provider device) while still running as the enrolled device.

A device already on the mesh adds a single relation with a standalone link
(`subnet invite` / `org invite` / `channel invite`) redeemed over its session.
